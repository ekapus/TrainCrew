# TrainCrew: Do more than run your train.
This app lets you use a browser (generally recommended on a phone or iPad) to simulate numerous railroad functions that can be performed while running trains.

Current functionality includes
- Handbrakes: Set and release.
- Airbrakes: Perform initial, intermediate and continuity tests.
- Switching: Couple, uncouple, and operate handbrakes.

The "app" is all written in plain HTML (using Bootstrap) and Javascript (using lots of Jquery), so running it and extending it should be relatively easy.

A live version can be found at http://traincrew.conrail1285.com, but you can easily set it up on your own web hosting.

This app was based on ideas from [How To Operate a Modern Switching Layout book](https://www.amazon.com/How-Operate-Modern-Switching-Layout/dp/1467956996) and the [PDC BNML Conductors App](http://www.pdc.ca/bnml/app.html).
